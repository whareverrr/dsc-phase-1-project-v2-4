### Overview

In this project, I aim to assist Microsoft in leveraging data-driven insights to establish its new venture into film production. 
As the company embarks on establishing its movie studio, my objective is to conduct exploratory data analysis to identify trends and patterns in the film industry, specifically focusing on box office performance. By analyzing datasets from various sources such as Box Office Mojo, IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and TheMovieDB, I seek to provide actionable recommendations to guide Microsoft in making informed decisions regarding the types of films to produce.

### Business Understanding

The film industry is constantly evolving, with new trends emerging and audience preferences shifting. As major companies like Netflix, Disney, and Amazon invest heavily in original content creation, Microsoft recognizes the opportunity to enter the realm of film production. However, with limited experience in the movie-making business, Microsoft faces the challenge of determining what types of films will resonate with audiences and achieve success at the box office.

Microsoft, in particular the management team in charge of the company's recent film production initiative, is the project's main stakeholder. The insights derived from this analysis will also be beneficial to important decision-makers in Microsoft entertainment division, such as producers, directors, and marketing executives. These stakeholders can choose the right films to make, manage resources wisely, and create efficient marketing campaigns by knowing consumer preferences and industry trends.

Questions the project aims to answer?

The project aims to answer several key questions to address the business problem faced by Microsoft in its new venture into film production. These questions include:

What are the current trends in the film industry, particularly in terms of box office performance and audience preferences?

Which genres are currently the most popular among audiences, and how do they vary in terms of box office revenue and critical reception?

What factors contribute to the success of a film at the box office, and how do they differ across genres?

How do audience ratings on platforms like IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes correlate with box office performance, and which platforms are most influential in driving audience engagement?

Are there specific production strategies or marketing approaches that have proven successful in maximizing box office revenue and audience satisfaction?

### Data Understanding

Introduction to the Dataset:

In my project, I leverage multiple datasets sourced from reputable platforms in the film industry to gain insights into various aspects of movie production, performance, and reception. These datasets provide a rich source of information essential for understanding the dynamics of the film industry and informing strategic decision-making for Microsoft's entry into film production.

The primary datasets utilized in our analysis include:

The Movie Database (TMDB) Dataset
Movie Budget Dataset 
Info_data Dataset
Reviews data Dataset

### Data Limitation

Limitations of the Data:

The data may be subject to biases and inaccuracies inherent in self-reported or user-generated content, such as user ratings on IMDb or Rotten Tomatoes.
Data availability and completeness may vary across sources, potentially limiting the scope of the analysis or introducing biases in the results.
The dataset may not capture all relevant factors influencing a movie's success, such as marketing strategies, distribution channels, or cultural influences.

### Data Analysis

After loading the datasets, I made sure everything was neat and tidy, like making sure all the data was in the right order and using the same units and terms throughout. This helps us understand the data better.

Next, I checked if there were any missing values in the datasets and figured out the best way to deal with them. Sometimes we filled in the gaps and sometimes we just left them out.

Then, I dug into the data to find out what kinds of movies people like and how well they do at the box office. By looking at things like popularity and earnings, we could see which movies were really hitting the mark with audiences.

I also took a closer look at different movie genres to see which ones were getting the most attention from viewers and making the most money. This helped us understand what kinds of movies people are really into.

We used some  techniques to analyze the data, like looking at averages, making graphs, and seeing how different variables relate to each other. These visual tools helped us spot trends and correlations in the data.

### Recommendations

(i) Movie Releases Strategy

Microsoft should strategically schedule movie releases by analyzing release patterns and competition dynamics. By targeting peak months with fewer competing movies, Microsoft can maximize audience attention and box office results. 

Additionally, by avoiding direct competition and adjusting release schedules in response to competitors' activities, Microsoft can enhance market positioning and increase the chances of success. 

Analyzing audience participation and preferences allows Microsoft to tailor content offers accordingly, increasing engagement and viewership. Overall, strategic release scheduling is essential for optimizing box office impact and ensuring the success of Microsoft's movie productions.
